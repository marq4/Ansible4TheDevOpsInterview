* What is Ansible and why we use it? 
	+ Agentless IT automation tool that replaces scripts with YAML Playbooks. 
	+ Saves time when dealing with many servers. 

* Example use case? 
	+ I want to reboot many servers (web, DB) in some particular order. 

* How does it work? 
	+ No need to install agent on servers that will be managed. 
	+ Linux: SSH. 
	+ Windows: PowerShell Remoting. 

* What is a Playbook? 
	+ 

* How do we set it up? 
	+ 

* What is a Module? 
	+ 

* How do we cofigure its default behaviour, location of Inventory and Log files? 
	+ In /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg: *4
	[defaults] 
	inventory 		= /etc/ansible/hosts 
	log_path  		= /var/log/ansible.log 

* How to configure Ansible for multiple fleets of servers like web, DB? 
	+ Replicate and edit ansible.cfg to /opt/ansible_playbooks/web, db; to override defaults. *2 

* Override all defaults and all /opt/ansible_playbooks temporarily? 
	+ Create special tmp-ansible.cfg under /root. 
	+ $ export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/root/tmp-ansible.cfg ansible-playbook playbook.yml # *1 

* Override a single param without copying & editing a config file? 
	+ Set env var ANSIBLE_ + name of param uppercase: $ export ANSIBLE_GATHERING=explicit 
	+ Verify with: $ ansible-config list 

* Take a look at the current config? 
	+ $ ansible-config dump 

* What is "Control Machine"? 
	+ 

* What is Inventory? 
	+ Information about target systems. 
	+ Default: /etc/ansible/hosts 
	+ Example (ini format): 
		[web]
		server1.company.com
		server2.company.com
		[db]					// Group. 
		db ansible_host=server3.company.com		// Alias. 

* Edit inventory file to add "db" server (define group databases) @ server4.company.com which is a Windows host (admin/pA$$wd): 
	+ 	[databases]
		db ansible_host=server4.company.com ansible_connection=winrm ansible_user=admin ansible_password=pA$$wd 
* Now define a super group "all" that contains groups databases, webservers, appservers: 
	+ 	[all:children] 
		databases 
		webservers 
		appservers 



* How do we make it more secure? 
	+ Instead of hardcoding the root password in the inventory with ansible_ssh_pass, we set up passwordless SSH with public/private key pairs. 
	+ Ansible Vault.
